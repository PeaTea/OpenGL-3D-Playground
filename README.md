# OpenGL 3D Playground

This is a personal playground for myself to check out some cool OpenGL 3D stuff and for general testing purposes.
This code can get messy and hard to read, since I always fill it with ideas - please don't mind that.

You're free to download the source code of my playground, even use some ideas in your programs, if you like - just remember to credit me.

I'm not responsible for any damage that could be caused by my code.


If you want to build this, you'll need the following:
  OpenGL  (3.0+)
  SDL     (Version 2.4.2)
  GLEW    (Version 2.0)
  GLM     (Version 0.9.7.6)
  

Have fun,
Peter
